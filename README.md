 **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

**PROJECT : AUTOMATED REPORT GENERATION**

**OBJECTIVE:**
   Automating the process of turning unstructured data into relevant reports with little human involvement is the aim of an Automated Report Generation project. Through the integration of several data sources, data analysis, and the production of aesthetically pleasing reports, this project aims to improve report generation efficiency, accuracy, and consistency. Report generation has historically involved the laborious and error-prone human collection, analysis, and formatting of data. Organizations can drastically cut down on the time and effort required to create reports by automating this operation, freeing up staff members to work on other important projects.
    Data extraction, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and report formatting are just a few of the steps that are usually included in an automated report production system. Data is collected from a variety of sources (such as databases, APIs, or spreadsheets), processed to guarantee consistency and correctness, and then examined to extract insights. The reports use visualization techniques, such charts and graphs, to help readers grasp complex material.
  Furthermore, the system may be made to produce reports in a variety of file types, such as HTML documents, Excel files, or PDFs, which makes it adaptable and simple to distribute. Additionally, it could have scheduling capabilities that enable reports to be created and sent out at predetermined times, guaranteeing that stakeholders always have access to the most recent information with minimal manual labor.
  Customizing reports is a crucial component of this project. Users can choose which data points or visualizations to include in the report by defining particular parameters or templates. Whether the generated reports are a summary for executives or a deep analysis for data specialists, this customisation guarantees that they satisfy the needs of various audiences. In conclusion, the main goal of an Automated Report Generation project is to streamline and optimize the reporting process, resulting in reports that are precise, timely, and configurable while lowering the possibility of errors and saving time.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
- **PYTHON :** Python is a high-level, easy-to-read programming language used for web development, data analysis, automation, and more.
- **VSCODE :** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, open-source code editor with support for debugging, version control, and extensions.
- **PANDAS :** Pandas is used for data analysis and manipulation, and it offers data structures like DataFrames to handle and analyze structured data effectively. It makes it simple to clean, transform, and explore data for activities involving analysis or machine learning.
- **FPDF :** It formats and generates the PDF report.
- **MATPLOTLIB :** Matplotlib is a plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It allows users to generate a wide variety of charts and graphs to visualize data insights effectively.
- **OS module :** Manages temporary file handling (e.g., deleting the chart after it's added to the report).
